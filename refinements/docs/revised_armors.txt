                        --------------

Is it possible to improve the game experience a lot, with "small" changes to some of
the most basic -and commonly accepted- rules?
It is, in our opinion, and some mods have proved it already.
Think about a world where wearing a full plate mail implies more things than merely
"raising your AC"... maybe, in such a world, a person wearing a full plate mail would
walk, in average, slower than an unarmored one. Probably he would feel uncomfortable
in many movements, and he'd lose something in agility.. and of course, he would be in
trouble if he wanted to do a supposedly quick and unnoticeable act like pick someone's
pocket...
Yet, he'd still consider the armor useful for combat situations, and he'd expect it to
prevent some hostile blows to reach their target, and maybe even to reduce the damage
they could inflict when they do hit.
Ok, you got the point. Of course it's just a game (already coded, too!), so one cannot
simulate the exact ways of reality, but the minimalistic ways of handling armors in the
original BG2 can be vastly improved, as you see.

With this component we introduce a new system for armors (and shields, to a less extent).
The use of armors imply, by default, the application of modifiers to several in-game
factors, like dexterity, thieving skills, movement rate, resistances about the various
types of weapons, and even spell casting failure chance (for Arcane spellcasters able
to *wear* armors in the first place).
The modifiers themselves depend on variables like base armor type, enchantment level,
specific enchantments placed on the item, unique features.
The final result is a system where you can no longer say "this armor is better than the
other one" just as long as your character is able to wear them (though it remains true
that "more powerful magic enchantments" *is* generally good): you'll have to tailor your
equipment to your specific situation, evaluating benefits and annoyances caused to your
characters depending on their own flaws and strong points.
In our humble opinion, this simply translates in "more fun" ;)



                        2) More detailed effects
                        --------------

-Wizardly spellcasting and Thieving abilities in armor is now permitted - with penalties, of course.

-Tables (all values are incremental in case there is already an effect modifying the statistic, so EG 
 in the shield section "AC Bonus: 0" means to leave unadultered the original SOA/TOB bonus, 1 would
 mean another point of AC):


ARMORS:
EN  - Enchantment level
DR  - Damage Resistance bonuses (Slashing/Piercing/Blunt/Missile) (%)
DEX - Dexterity penalty
Mov - Movement Rate penalty (%)
SF  - Wizardly Spellcasting Failure increase (%)
TS  - Thieving Skill penalty (PickP/OpenL/FindT/MoveS/Hide) (%)

 component), the dexterity requirements from that mod are reduced by three points.



                        3) Install time choices
                        --------------

-Differently from nearly all mods (at least by the time of the first 'public' release of
 this component, AKA late 2005), you are asked whether you would like to change the descriptions
 of the items at the same time you install the mod. If you're a non-English player you can also 
 choose wether you prefer to install descriptions in English, in case it's missing in your language, 
 or to go for a 100% unadulterated \(French\|Italian\|...\) game (even though some descriptions may not
  be accurated this way).
-Further, you can decide to remove the Movement Rate penalty, while keeping the other changes of the mod.
