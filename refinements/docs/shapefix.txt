** Shapeshifting Fix  **
************************




                      1)New fix for Shapeshifting
                      ---------------------------


Refinements includes a new fix for the infamous Shapeshifting bug. Shapeshifting in the original
game didn't get the intended bonuses in the target forms, and also the paws (or specific weapons) 
were dispellable!
Unfortunately the problem resides in the inner code of the game, so only work-arounds can be 
attempted. 
Westley Weimer provided (for some of the forms) a really smart and revolutionary solution, which 
unfortunately still has some problems, especially for players who are concerned with "roleplaying" 
consistency: the player has to equip the paws himself and this may seem a bit odd. 
So, we've taken the really good idea from Weimer and added some thought of our own :)
With this fix the player can finally use shapeshifting as originally intended: they gain all the
resistances and immunities of the target forms, but they also lose the capability to cast spells
and talk (otherwise you'd just want to remain a werewolf or a Fire Elemental forever...).
Yes, the paws can still be dispelled, unluckily, but... they will reappear after a short while,
so the player has nothing to bother with.
The current maximum delay for this to happen has been choosen after some performance tests.

All the forms available to the various kinds of druids have been fixed: wolf, bear, spider, wyvern, 
salamander, and werewolf.
Furthermore, turning back to the natural form now heals the druid somewhat. 
Regarding the elemental forms gained as HLAs, a fix and a complete revision are included in the 
first component of this mod, for which we added the two missing elemental forms (air and water) 
and reunited them all under the same ability.

The cost of this fix is tolerable in our opinion: a few portrait icons cannot be displayed for
the character while shapeshifted. Hey... The world is not perfect :)
Last thing: turning back to a humanoid from the Shapeshifters' werewolf forms now requires a round.
The other forms do not have enough fitting animations for such an adjustment and we also wanted to 
emphasize the difference with the other cases (shapeshifters are affected by lycanthropy, they 
really have to dominate their "beast side"). Werewolf forms are also very powerful after all,
especially if you pick the "Feral Spirit" HLA (included again in the first component of this mod). 


                        3) Install time choices
                        --------------

-You can choose wether the healing happens when reverting to human (standard choice) or when
 morphing to an animal (or lycantrop, or whatever). The second choice was coded by Borsook.
