DWSHLD01
--------
A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield.  Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using his shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield.  Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from 3'-4' in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a spread dragon's wings.  A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward.

hide
--------
Hide Armor is made from the thick skin of large animals (elephants, for example) or layers of thinner, more common leather.  It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids.  It offers better protection than normal leather, but can be hard to maintain, often resulting in an offensive odor or shoddy appearance that prevents effective use.  Thieves can wear this armor, but it has a negative effect on their abilities.

splint
--------
Splint Mail is a variant of banded mail in which the metal strips are applied vertically to the backing of chain, leather, or cloth rather than horizontally as in banded mail.  Since the human body does not swivel in mid-torso as much as it flexes back to front, splint mail is more restrictive in battle.

studded
--------
Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor.  Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing.  The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place.
