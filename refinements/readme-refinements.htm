		<h4>
		Introduction
		</h4>
		<p>
		The Refinements Mod is somewhat of an arrogant project.
		<br>We feel that many things in the game are somehow misplaced, not detailed enough, not balanced enough, not cool enough, or... you get the picture.
		<br>So we've tried to fix them, with the aim to provide a fitting new standard form for the game.
		<br>We don't know how many people will agree with this presumption, but we'll act as if they are many.
		<br>
		<br>This project started with one us (Littiz) offering to WeiDU-code some material the other author (T.G.Maestro) was producing for personal use (new HLAs and tables for various classes, to be exact).
		<br>Some things don't deserve to be wasted :)
		<br>We have focused on different things, but "kept an eye" on each other, shared ideas, corrected things and much more.
		<br>Now we feel this mod is our "common property"!
		<br>
		<br>It's still an evolving work; you never know how many things you may want to refine, given time  :D
						<br>We provide separate, detailed documentation for each installable component, so some advice for the lazy player: 
		</p>
		<div class="divimp">
		<b>CHECK THE DOCS! They ARE part of the mod!!!</b>
		</div>
		<p>
		We try to provide as much in-game documentation as possible, but these docs will always be more detailed.

		<h4>
		Compatibility notes
		</h4>
		<p>
		<br>Some components of this mod are meant to be used along with other mods (we strongly suggest to use aVENGER's Rogue Rebalancing Mod, and Sim's Virtue Mod).
    <br>ToBEx is strongly recommended as well: 'Allow 1280 Total Kits' is required if you installed a lot of kit mods, 'Kit() Trigger Fix' is required if you installed a mod to enable Barbarian -> Mage, Barbarian -> Thief or Wild Mage -> Thief dual classes, and the following are recommended in any case: 'Apply Casting Level Bonus' and 'Assassin and Bounty Hunter Penalty to Similar Kits'.
    <br>Furthermore, some components raise issues with the order of installation.
		<br>We detail case by case what you need to know, but here's our...
		</p>

		<div class="divimp">
						<strong>"Simplified" ordering rule:

		<br>Install Refinements AFTER other mods, but BEFORE starting a new game.
		<br>These mods make an exception and should be installed AFTER Refinements:</strong>
		<ul class="version-list">
		<!--		          <li>Virtue</li> -->
		<li>The Bigg's Tweak Pack</li>
		<li>Kivan of Shilmista</li>
		<!--		          <li>Return to Windspear (this one depends on <em>actual</em> availability of
		that mod)</li> -->
		</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
		This is the quickest way to deal with all the aforementioned issues. It will work fine, but you might lose some alternatives granted by other mods. If you want full control over the installation, read our docs and choose how to proceed ;)</p>

		<div class="divimp">
		<strong>Also note that item mods need to receive manual handling on our part, so they aren't compatible unless explicitly listed.</strong>
		</div>
		<p>The currently compatible item mods are:</p>
		<ul class="version-list">
		<li>Rogue Rebalancing</li>
		<li>Item Upgrade</li>
		<li>Ruad</li>
		<li>Freedom's Reign</li>
		<li>Reign of Virtue</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If your favorite mod isn't listed here, please <a href=#contact>contact us</a> and we'll try to rectify for the next release. (note: we won't make the needed work for TDD / BP kits; we might do it for the items, though.)</p>

		<h4>
		Installation
		</h4>
		<h5>
		Windows
		</h5>
		<p>
		Refinements is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.
		<br>
		<br>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using WinRAR. If properly extracted, you should have a Refinements folder, setup-Refinements.tp2 and Setup-Refinements.exe in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-Refinements.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
		<br>
		<br>Please re-run Setup-Refinements.exe in your BG2 folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.
		</p>

        <h5>
         Macintosh
        </h5>
        <p>
					<i>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
					new version. Please note that this mod is incompatible with Mod Organizer. </i>
					Refinements is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract
					the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder. If properly extracted, you should
					have a Refinements folder, setup-Refimenents.tp2, Setup-Refinements, and
					Setup-Refinements.command in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click
					Setup-Refinements.command and follow the instructions on screen.
        </p>

		<h5>
		Linux
		</h5>
		<p>
		Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from
		<a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least)
		the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G.
		/usr/bin).
		<br>Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory,
	run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.
		<br><span class='small'>
		You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it
		once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered,
	so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either
		if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file
		name.
		<br>If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe
		bet.
		</span>
		<br>After that, run 'weinstall refinements' from your BG2
		installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.

					<li>Endurance HLA doesn't stack or stacks or something with Boots of Speed.</li>

					<li>Removed the stutter-causing Damage Resistance Cap. Feel free to get 127% slashing
					damage, you dirty cheater  :)</li>
					<li>Armor Revision is now compatible with many more item mods, also thanks to code

          16 January 2006 - Version 3.02:

        </p>
        <ul class="version-list">
          <li>An attempt to fix the bard songs. Our engine is struggling to be uncooperative, sadly, which means
          that issues will arise from time to time.
          <li>New subcomponent: swashImoen has Detect Illusions rather than Set Traps.
          <li>New subcomponent: heal on morphing to animal form, rather than on morphing back to human.
          This component was coded by Borsook.
          <li>Armors from the Ashes of Embers mod are patched by AR. Scale are assimilated to Hide, Banded to Splint,
          and Field to Plate, except that plate starts from 2 AC rather than 3. This may not be 100% realistic,
          however AR was coded with the equation 'higher base AC = heavier' in mind.
          <li>WeiDU v187 allows me to code sligtly different choices more easily, so part of the nonsense
          when installing the Armor Revision is removed. Also, a number of other changes for faster installation.
          <li>Polish Translation by Yarpen.
        </ul>
        <p class="version">

				   risk of causing harm to the party.
				  <li>Added an alternate SwashImoen, which will just change her kit.
				  <li>Trueclass thieves now correctly "forget" thief innates upon dualling
			   	to Fighter or Cleric (until reactivation of the starting class).
